## 📋 Overview

This repository contains R scripts for reproducing all analyses related to the CSKT AWARE project. It currently includes analyses for project years 2 and 3.

## 🔄 Analysis Workflow


1. Raw data from each survey or data source is processed using dedicated R scripts to create constructs for analysis.

2. The processed data is then merged, analysed, and the results are compiled into Excel files, with multiple sheets corresponding to each analysis



## 📅️ Year 2

#### 🔍 Data sources

1. 🌍 Culture survey 
2. 🧘 Health/wellness survey

#### 🛠️ Processing scripts

These scripts generate condensed data sets with demographic variables and survey constructs necessary for analysis.

- `CreateCultureSurveyConstructs_Year2_022624.R`
- `CreateHealthWellnessConstructs_Year2_022624.R`

#### 📈 Analysis Script

Subsequent analyses were performed using:​

`DescriptiveAnalysis_Year2_022624.R`

This script produces a single 📊 Excel file (`DescriptiveTablesYear2_022624.xlsx`) containing the following outputs:

1) Basic demographic table by adult/youth
2) Item-level frequencies by adult/youth
3) Scale scores from both surveys by adult/youth
4) Correlation tables for scale scores by adult/youth

&nbsp; All output files are stored on 📦 Box in: *Year 2 Data Analyses Datasets -- Adam -> Analysis results*



## 📅️️ Year 3 


#### 🔍 Data sources

1. 🌍 Culture survey 
2. 🧘 Health/wellness survey
3. 🔥 Encampment
4. 🥁 Activity data 

#### 🛠️ Processing scripts

- `CreateDemosAcrossAllSources_050225.R` -- this combines demographic data across all sources 
- `CreateCultureSurveyConstructs_Year3_160924.R`
- `CreateHealthWellnessConstructs_Year3_151124.R`
- `CreateEncampmentConstructs_Year3_121124.R`
- `CreateActivityConstructs_Year3_280824.R`

These scripts generate condensed data sets with demographic variables and survey constructs necessary for analysis.

#### 📈 Analysis Script

Subsequent analyses were performed using:​

`DescriptiveAnalysis_Year3_151124.R`

These analysis focus on 240 kids with activity data.

This script produces a single 📊 Excel file (`DescriptiveAnalyses_Year3_191124.xlsx`) containing the following outputs:

1) Basic demographic table by district
2) Means (SD) for each outcome, by district
3) Correlation table for all outcomes

Analyses were performed separately for 🔥️ encampment using `DescriptivesEncampment_311024.R`

This script produces an 📊 Excel file (`EncampmentResultsYr3_110424.xlsx`) containing the following outputs:

1) Descriptives
2) Outcome descriptives by pre and post
3) Outcomes descriptives for youth
4) Correlations of outcome scores among adults
5) Correlations of outcomes scores among youth
6) Item frequencies for adults
7) Item frequencies for youth
